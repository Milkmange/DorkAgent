        ## Execution Process - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS
        1. Execute EACH of the 30 queries in sequence - DO NOT SKIP ANY QUERIES
        2. Document results for each query even if it returns nothing
        3. Continue until ALL 30 queries have been executed
        4. Only then compile final results

        ## Search Guidelines
        - Execute each query exactly in the format specified above.
        - If a query returns no results, immediately proceed to the next google dork.
        - ONLY report URLs that you ACTUALLY find in the search results.
        - NEVER fabricate or hallucinate any URLs or search results.
        - If all queries return no results, return empty results list.
        - Search only within the provided domain; do not expand the search scope.

        ## Exclusion Criteria
        - Exclude results containing the following keywords (high false positive likelihood):
          * Common documents: "Advertisement", "Agreement", "Terms", "Policy", "License", "Disclaimer"
          * Support materials: "API Docs", "Forum", "Help", "Community", "Code of Conduct", "Knowledge Base", "Support Center", "Customer Support"
          * Development content: "Developers", "Statement", "Support", "Rules", "Docs", "Developer Portal", "Engineering Blog"
          * Example content: "example", "sample", "demo", "dummy", "placeholder", "mockup"
          * Documents: "Guideline", "Template", "Documentation", "User Manual", "Reference Guide"
          * Corporate communications: "About Us", "Press", "Media", "Careers"

        - Also exclude:
          * Files with naming patterns like:
            - "example_*", "sample_*", "demo_*", "*_sample.*", "*_demo.*"
          * Content that appears non-production:
            - Sequential IDs (user1, user2, user3)
            - Dummy email patterns (test@example.com, admin@localhost, user@test.com)
            - Placeholder usernames (admin, root, temp, organizer)
          * Content with artificial data patterns:
            - Generic sequential identifiers
            - Predictable naming conventions
          * Training materials or documentation examples
          * Onboarding and introductory content

        - Comprehensive URL filtering:
          * Exclude URLs containing subdirectories like:
            - "/help/"
            - "/support/"
            - "/docs/"
            - "/examples/"
            - "/tutorial/"
          * Avoid results from known documentation domains
          * Filter out URLs with explicit non-production indicators

        # Vulnerability and Attack Vector Analysis

        ## Objective
        Analyze the Google Dorking results found by the searcher to identify potential security vulnerabilities or attack vectors.

        ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
        - ONLY analyze URLs that were ACTUALLY found by the searcher in Task 1.
        - DO NOT invent, fabricate, or hallucinate any vulnerabilities or findings.
        - If no URLs were found by the searcher, report that no vulnerabilities could be identified.
        - DO NOT use example data from this prompt as actual findings.
        - ALWAYS base your analysis SOLELY on real search results.

        ## Filtering Example Data
        - EXCLUDE any files with names containing words like "example", "sample", "demo", "dummy"
        - Do not report vulnerabilities based on example, training files
        - Be skeptical of data that looks too perfect or follows obvious patterns (e.g., sequential IDs, test@example.com)
        - For user data, verify it appears to be actual user information rather than placeholder content
        - If data contains elements like "example_value_based_audience_file" or similar indicators of non-production data, exclude it
        - Pay special attention to file metadata, headers, or comments that might indicate example status

        ## Field Classification Guide
        **IMPORTANT: Understand the difference between discovery_type and category fields:**

        ### Discovery Type Classification:
        - **"Vulnerability"**: Use when finding represents an actual security flaw or weakness
          - Examples: SQL Injection, XSS, exposed credentials, misconfigured services
          - Criteria: Something that can be directly exploited or poses immediate security risk
        
        - **"Attack Vector"**: Use when finding represents a potential attack path or information gathering point
          - Examples: parameter manipulation points, admin panel discovery, directory listings, URL patterns
          - Criteria: Information useful for further reconnaissance or potential attack entry points

        ### Category Field:
        Use one of the 26 predefined categories below (separate from discovery_type)

        ### Examples of Correct Field Usage:
        ```
        URL: /admin/login.php
        - discovery_type: "Attack Vector" (potential entry point)
        - category: "Admin Panel"

        URL: /config.php (containing database passwords)
        - discovery_type: "Vulnerability" (actual security flaw)  
        - category: "Sensitive Data Exposure"

        URL: /api/users?id=123
        - discovery_type: "Attack Vector" (parameter manipulation point)
        - category: "IDOR"
        ```

        ## Analysis Categories
        Analyze findings using one of the following 26 security categories that match the Pydantic model:

        **File and Directory Exposure:**
        - Directory Listing: Exposed directory browsing allowing enumeration of files and folders
        - Configuration Files: Exposed configuration files containing sensitive settings
        - Backup Files: Accessible backup files that may contain sensitive data or code
        - Development Environment: Exposed development/staging environments with debugging info

        **Information Disclosure:**
        - Information Disclosure: General information leakage not fitting other categories
        - Sensitive Data Exposure: Exposed PII, credentials, or confidential business data
        - Token Exposure: Exposed API keys, access tokens, session tokens, or authentication credentials
        - OSINT: Open Source Intelligence gathering revealing organizational information

        **Authentication and Access Control:**
        - Admin Panel: Exposed administrative interfaces or management consoles
        - IDOR: Insecure Direct Object References allowing unauthorized data access

        **Injection Vulnerabilities:**
        - XSS: Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in input fields or output contexts
        - Cross Site Scripting: Alternative classification for XSS findings
        - SQL Injection: Database injection vulnerabilities through user inputs
        - Command Injection: Operating system command injection attack vectors
        - LFI/RFI: Local or Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities

        **Web Application Security:**
        - CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities
        - Clickjacking: UI redressing attacks through iframe manipulation
        - Open Redirect: Unvalidated redirects leading to malicious sites
        - Server Side Request Forgery: SSRF vulnerabilities allowing internal network access
        - Path Traversal: Directory traversal vulnerabilities accessing unauthorized files

        **File Handling:**
        - API Exposure: Exposed APIs revealing functionality or data
        - File Upload/Download: Insecure file handling mechanisms

        **Infrastructure and Cloud:**
        - Cloud Storage Misconfiguration: Publicly accessible cloud storage buckets or containers
        - Social Engineering: Information useful for social engineering attacks
        - Subdomain Enumeration: Discovery of additional subdomains expanding attack surface

        **CMS-Specific:**
        - WordPress Vulnerabilities: WordPress-specific security issues and misconfigurations

        **General:**
        - Misc: Miscellaneous findings not fitting other specific categories

        ## Severity Assessment Criteria
        - Critical: Direct system access or sensitive data exposure (credentials, tokens, PII)
        - High: Access to important functions/data (source code, configuration files, internal documents)
        - Medium: Vulnerabilities with limited impact (partial information disclosure, potential injection points)
        - Low: Information exposure without a direct attack vector

        expected_output="Analyze the Google Dorking search results and provide detailed vulnerability and attack vector findings.
